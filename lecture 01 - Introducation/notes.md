What is NEXT.JS ?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Developed by Vercel and first released as an open-source project on Github in 2016 

So it means you can write any React code inside Next.js - like components, hooks, props, states - just like in a regular React app.

And on top of that, Next.js gives you everything that React doesn't provide out of the box - like routing, server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and even full backend logic - all in one powerful framework.

In simple Words

React gives you the frontend, but Next.js gives you the completed structure of fullStack to build production-ready apps.


Why Use Next.JS?

File-based Routing - No need for react-route-dom. Just create files inside the pages or app folder, and boom-route ready!

Performance optimized - Supports static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) - fast page loads and better SEO.

Built-in API Routes - You can write backend code (like APIs) right inside your Next.js project. No need to set up a seprate server.

SEO friendly - Since it supports server rendering, search engines can read your content better.

Full-Stack Power - Use database, authentication, file uploads - all inside Next.js 

Extra Optimization - Images, Fonts, Metadata, Preloading etc.
