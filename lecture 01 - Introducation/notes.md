# What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Developed by Vercel and released as open source in 2016, it allows you to use all standard React features—components, hooks, props, and state—while adding powerful capabilities on top.

Next.js provides features that React alone does not, such as routing, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and backend logic, all within a single framework.

**In summary:**  
React handles the frontend, but Next.js offers a complete full-stack structure for building production-ready apps.

## Why Use Next.js?

- **File-based Routing:** No need for `react-router-dom`. Just create files in the `pages` or `app` folder, and routes are set up automatically.
- **Performance Optimized:** Supports SSG and SSR for fast page loads and improved SEO.
- **Built-in API Routes:** Write backend API code directly in your Next.js project—no separate server required.
- **SEO Friendly:** Server rendering makes your content more accessible to search engines.
- **Full-Stack Capabilities:** Integrate databases, authentication, file uploads, and more within Next.js.
- **Extra Optimization:** Built-in support for image optimization, custom fonts, metadata, preloading, and more.

## When to Choose Next.js

Next.js is ideal for projects that require SEO optimization, fast loading times, or a combination of static and dynamic content. It's especially well-suited for e-commerce sites, blogs, marketing websites, and any application where performance and search engine visibility are important.

The framework scales from simple landing pages to complex applications with thousands of pages.
